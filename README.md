# RotAgent
Rotation Agent a rotation profile for Probably Engine

## Usage
**left shift**
* Will pause the routine. Stops any current casts, stops attacking and puts your pet on follow.

**left alt**
* Force Arcane Shot or Multi-Shot to apply Serpent Sting to the mouseover target. This is useful as the routine will not automatically use Arcane Shot or Multi-Shot on Units that you are not in combat with. The toggle for 'Mouseover Serpent Sting' must be on.

**left control**
* Will throw a Freezing Trap at your mouseover targets feet. This is useful while in combat so you don't inadvertently apply Serpent Sting to a unit that you want to CC.

**right alt**
* This will cast Misdirection onto your current Focus target if you have one. If you do not have a Focus target it will not attempt to misdirect.
